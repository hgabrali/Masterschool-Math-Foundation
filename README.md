### Project Scope

This project's primary objective is to deepen my understanding of core mathematical principles essential for data science. It focuses on conceptual and practical applications, bridging theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation. Key areas of focus include:

-   **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing and visualizing data sets to understand their key characteristics.
-   **Probability Theory**: Exploring fundamental concepts of probability and their role in predictive modeling.
-   **Statistical Distributions**: Implementing and analyzing various probability distributions (e.g., Normal, Binomial, Poisson) to model real-world phenomena.
-   **Inferential Statistics**: Making inferences and drawing conclusions about a population based on sample data.

---

### Key Takeaways

Through this project, I aim to achieve proficiency in:

-   Using Python libraries like **NumPy** and **SciPy** for statistical computations.
-   Applying **Pandas** for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
-   Creating informative visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to communicate statistical findings.
-   Implementing conditional logic and functions to automate analytical tasks.
